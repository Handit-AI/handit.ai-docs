<summary>**AI App Nightmares: What No One Tells You**</summary>

Imagine it’s 3 AM and you’re staring at your console—again. You just fixed that one prompt for the tenth time, only to discover your AI replied to “Uncle Bob” instead of your manager. 😱

At first, you laugh it off. It’s “just a glitch.” Then it happens again: sometimes it ghosts you completely, sometimes it hijacks the CC line, and once it even quoted a message from two weeks ago like a deranged time traveler. You tweak the prompt, pray to the data gods, and whisper “please and thank you” like a mantra… but two weeks later, the ghost is back.

This isn’t a haunted house—it’s your AI pipeline. And yes, LLMs can gaslight you. They’ll whisper “I didn’t do it,” even as they rewrite your email thread into gibberish. You patch one leak and another springs open. You think, “There has to be a better way.”

Handit.ai is the open-source Ghostbuster for your AI nightmares. With live monitoring, automated A/B hunting, and AI-as-Judge evaluations on real traffic, it spots phantom failures and banishes them before they strike again. No more 3 AM panics or unsent apologies.
