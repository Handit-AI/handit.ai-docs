## Tracing

### Without Handit (Static Processing)

#### **‚ùå Static AI: No Learning, No Improvement, No Visibility**

When you process documents without Handit's self-improving AI system, you're stuck with static performance that never gets better:

#### üîç **Zero Visibility Into Processing Performance**
- **No insight into classification decisions**: Why was this medical report classified as an invoice?
- **Can't identify bottlenecks**: Which step is causing the 3.2-second delays?
- **Missing failure patterns**: Same vision AI errors repeat without detection
- **No optimization data**: Can't measure if prompt changes improve accuracy

#### üìä **Limited Debugging Capabilities**
```javascript
// What you see in basic processing:
console.log('üìÑ Document processed:', documentId);
console.log('üè∑Ô∏è Classification result:', classification);
console.log('üìù Summary generated');

// What you DON'T know:
- How long each AI operation took
- Which prompts are performing poorly
- What document types consistently cause issues
- Token usage and cost per request
- Vision AI confidence scores for images
```

#### üö® **Processing Blind Spots**
- **Quality mystery**: Why do some documents get 85% accuracy while others fail?
- **Performance inconsistency**: Can't pinpoint what causes processing delays
- **Resource waste**: Over-provisioning because you don't know actual usage patterns
- **Cost escalation**: No visibility into token usage and API spending

#### üí∏ **Business Impact Without Observability**
- **Reactive debugging**: Only discover issues after classification failures
- **Slow improvement cycles**: Takes weeks to identify and fix processing problems
- **Missed optimization**: Can't leverage successful processing patterns for improvement
- **Higher operational costs**: Inefficient operations due to lack of processing insights

### With Handit AI (Self-Improving Processing)

#### **‚úÖ Self-Improving AI: The Power of Handit's 3-Phase System**

**Think of Handit as creating an AI scientist for your document processing** - it observes every decision, evaluates quality with LLM-as-Judge, detects patterns in failures, generates better prompts, tests improvements automatically, and provides you with proven optimizations.

Handit transforms your document processing from static AI to a self-improving system that gets smarter with every document processed.

#### üîç **Comprehensive Document Processing Observability**

Document processing AI is inherently complex - it extracts text from multiple formats, classifies types with AI, summarizes content with LLMs, and chains operations together. Without tracing, you're debugging in the dark when documents get misprocessed.

**Real implementation with Handit tracking:**

```javascript
// From your actual documentAgent.js - Full tracing integration
await trackNode({
    input: {
        messages: [
            { role: "system", content: optimizedSystemPrompt },
            { role: "user", content: documentContent.substring(0, 3000) }
        ],
        documentLength: documentContent.length,
        categories: categories.length
    },
    output: classificationResult,
    nodeName: 'classifyDocument',
    agentName: 'document_classification',
    nodeType: 'llm',
    executionId
});
```

**What you get with Handit:**
- **Complete processing flow** of every document through your system
- **Every AI operation** with exact prompts, responses, and performance metrics for classification and summarization
- **All tool executions** including vision AI results, OCR confidence scores, and multi-format processing
- **Decision points and reasoning chains** showing why specific classifications were chosen
- **Context flow between operations** from document upload to final structured output

#### üö® **Pinpoint Exact Failures in Document Processing**

Your document processor might be failing because of poor vision AI extraction from images, classification prompt issues, or logic errors in the summarization chain. Handit tracing shows you exactly where and why.

```javascript
// Example: Invoice image misclassified as medical document
{
  "executionId": "doc_20241201_154230",
  "failure_point": "classifyDocument",
  "document_type": "invoice_image.jpg",
  "vision_extraction": "Patient: John Doe, Invoice #12345...",
  "expected_classification": "Receipt/Invoice",
  "actual_classification": "Medical Document", 
  "root_cause": "Vision AI extracted patient reference from invoice template",
  "fix_suggestion": "Improve classification prompt to distinguish invoice headers from medical content",
  "tokens_used": 1150,
  "processing_time_ms": 2100
}
```

**What you get:**
- **Pinpoint exact failure locations** in your document processing chains
- **See the exact vision AI extractions** that caused classification errors
- **Track error propagation** through your processing workflow
- **Access complete processing context** including token usage and timing
- **Compare successful vs failed** document processing runs with detailed metrics

**Why it matters**: Instead of spending hours reproducing document processing bugs, you see exactly what happened in production. Debug in minutes instead of days.

#### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization for Document Excellence**

See which parts of your document processor are slow or causing poor results. Optimize vision AI settings, reduce unnecessary operations, and improve processing speed with data, not guesswork.

```javascript
// Real performance breakdown from your system:
{
  "total_time": "1.8s",
  "breakdown": {
    "text_extraction": "0.5s",  
    "vision_ai_processing": "0.7s",

## Evaluation

### Without Handit (Static Processing)

#### **‚ùå The Static AI Trap: No Learning, No Improvement**

Picture this: Your document processing system handles thousands of documents daily - invoices, contracts, medical reports, technical documentation. Your AI maintains 85% accuracy but never gets better. The same types of misclassifications happen repeatedly because your AI can't learn from its mistakes. You manually review 100 documents and find issues, but the AI will make the same errors tomorrow because it's static.

**üö® The Static AI Problem**
- **No Learning Mechanism**: AI repeats the same mistakes indefinitely  
- **Manual Improvement Only**: Developers must manually identify and fix issues
- **No Systematic Quality Control**: Spot-checking can't catch all problems
- **Reactive Problem Solving**: Issues discovered after they've already impacted users
- **No Optimization Path**: No way to systematically improve AI performance over time

**üìä What You're Missing Without Automated Evaluation:**
```javascript
// Your current "evaluation" process:
console.log('üìù Manually reviewed 100/5000 documents today');
console.log('‚ùì Found some classification issues, accuracy seems around 85%');
console.log('‚è∞ Review took 6 hours of human time');
console.log('üí∞ Token usage: 1,200 per request, costs escalating');
console.log('ü§∑ No clear improvement path identified');

// What you DON'T know:
- Which 4,900 documents had classification issues?
- What specific patterns cause misclassification in vision AI?
- How often does the summarization miss key details?
- Which prompts consistently produce poor results?
- Are PDF documents classified better than images?
- What's the real cost per successful classification?
```

**üí∏ The Business Cost of Poor Evaluation**
- **Downstream errors**: Misclassified documents cause workflow failures
- **Resource waste**: Manual reviewers spending hours on spot-checking
- **Missed optimization**: No systematic improvement insights
- **Compliance risk**: Unable to ensure all document processing meets standards
- **Cost escalation**: High token usage without optimization

### With Handit AI (Self-Improving Processing)

#### **‚úÖ Self-Improving AI: LLM-as-Judge + Automatic Optimization**

Handit transforms your document processing from static AI to a self-improving system that learns from every mistake. Using LLM-as-Judge technology, it evaluates every document, detects quality patterns, automatically generates better prompts, and provides you with proven improvements - all while maintaining full control over what gets deployed.

**üéØ The 3-Phase Self-Improving Process**

Handit creates a complete learning loop that turns your static AI into a continuously improving system:

```javascript
// Phase 1: Observability - Track every operation
await trackNode({
  input: { userMessage, documentType: "invoice" },
  output: { classification: "Receipt/Invoice", confidence: 0.85 },
  nodeName: "document_classification",
  nodeType: "llm",
  executionId
});

// Phase 2: Evaluation - LLM-as-Judge scores quality
{
  "evaluation_results": {
    "classification_accuracy": 0.75,    // Below target threshold  
    "extraction_quality": 0.82,        // Acceptable but could improve
    "summary_relevance": 0.68,         // Needs improvement
    "pattern_detected": "Invoice classification issues with vendor names"
  }
}

// Phase 3: Optimization - AI generates better prompt
{
  "optimization_generated": {
    "problem_analysis": "Classification struggles with vendor name variations",
    "improved_prompt": "Enhanced classification prompt with vendor pattern recognition",
    "expected_improvement": "+15% accuracy on invoice classification",
    "ready_for_deployment": true,
    "statistical_confidence": 0.94
  }
}

// Deployment: Fetch the optimized prompt when ready
const optimizedPrompt = await fetchOptimizedPrompt({
  modelId: "document_classification"
});
```

**üöÄ Self-Improving AI at Scale**
- **Complete Observability**: Every operation tracked with `startTracing()`, `trackNode()`, `endTracing()`
- **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**: Automated quality assessment on every document
- **AI-Generated Optimizations**: System automatically creates better prompts based on detected issues

Handit's evaluation system uses **single-purpose evaluators** - each evaluator focuses on one specific quality dimension. These evaluators can be associated with one or many LLM nodes in your document processing system.

### **Core Evaluator Types for Document Processing**

#### **1. Coherence Evaluation**
*Evaluates logical structure and flow of generated summaries and classifications*

```javascript
// Coherence Evaluator - Can be applied to classification and summarization nodes
{
  name: "coherence_evaluator",
  focus: "Logical structure and natural flow of generated text",
  applies_to: ["document_classification", "content_summarization"],
  scoring_criteria: {
    "10/10": "Logically structured, flows naturally, maintains clarity",
    "8-9/10": "Minor flow disruptions, overall readability preserved", 
    "4-7/10": "Noticeable inconsistencies, unclear references",
    "0-3/10": "Lacks logical progression, contains contradictions"
  },
  checks_for: [
    "Logical consistency without contradictions",
    "Clear pronoun and subject references", 
    "Smooth transitions between ideas",
    "Natural flow without abrupt topic shifts"
  ]
}
```

#### **2. Correctness Evaluation** 
*Verifies factual accuracy and adherence to system prompt rules*

```javascript
// Correctness Evaluator - Applied to both classification and summarization
{
  name: "correctness_evaluator", 
  focus: "Factual accuracy and system prompt compliance",
  applies_to: ["document_classification", "content_summarization", "vision_ai_extraction"],
  scoring_criteria: {
    "10/10": "Fully aligns with reference input, no factual distortions",
    "8-9/10": "One or two small inaccuracies, overall meaning preserved",
    "4-7/10": "Some incorrect details, but still somewhat useful", 
    "0-3/10": "Contains hallucinations, fabrications, or major misinterpretations"
  },
  checks_for: [
    "Factual accuracy against source documents",
    "Correct numbers, names, dates, locations",
    "No hallucinated or fabricated details",
    "Adherence to system prompt constraints"
  ]
}
```

#### **3. Formatting Evaluation**
*Ensures adherence to structural guidelines and style requirements*

```javascript
// Formatting Evaluator - Applied to structured output nodes
{
  name: "formatting_evaluator",
  focus: "Structure, style, and formatting compliance", 
  applies_to: ["content_summarization", "structured_extraction"],
  scoring_criteria: {
    "10/10": "Strictly follows required structure, grammar, punctuation",
    "8-9/10": "Small deviation but overall formatting clear",
    "4-7/10": "Several errors affecting readability or prompt adherence",
    "0-3/10": "Completely incorrect format or unreadable output"
  },
  checks_for: [
    "Required structure (JSON, lists, paragraphs)",
    "Grammar, punctuation, and style consistency", 
    "Proper spacing, alignment, and indentation",
    "Compliance with tone and style requirements"
  ]
}
```

#### **4. Hallucination & Factual Accuracy Evaluation**
*Detects fabricated content and ensures 100% grounding in source material*

```javascript
// Hallucination Evaluator - Critical for document processing accuracy
{
  name: "hallucination_evaluator",
  focus: "100% factual grounding and fabrication detection",
  applies_to: ["document_classification", "content_summarization", "vision_ai_extraction"],
  scoring_criteria: {
    "9-10/10": "All facts accurate, no hallucinated details",
    "6-8/10": "One or two minor factual errors",
    "4-5/10": "Several factual problems", 
    "0-3/10": "Major inaccuracies or hallucinations throughout"
  },
  checks_for: [
    "Every fact matches or is supported by input",
    "No invented names, dates, numbers, or claims",
    "Catches subtle distortions and misrepresentations",
    "Distinguishes natural elaboration from fabrication"
  ]
}
```

### **Evaluator-to-Node Mapping for Document Processing**

```javascript
// How evaluators map to your LLM nodes (1 evaluator can apply to many nodes)
const evaluatorMappings = {
  "document_classification": [
    "correctness_evaluator",    // Ensure accurate document type identification
    "coherence_evaluator",      // Check classification reasoning is logical
    "hallucination_evaluator"   // Prevent fabricated document categories
  ],
  
  "content_summarization": [
    "correctness_evaluator",    // Verify summary matches source content
    "coherence_evaluator",      // Ensure summary flows logically
    "formatting_evaluator",     // Check structured summary format
    "hallucination_evaluator"   // Prevent fabricated summary details
  ],
  
  "vision_ai_extraction": [
    "correctness_evaluator",    // Verify extracted text matches image
    "hallucination_evaluator"   // Prevent invented text not in image
  ]
};
