# Evaluation

> **Automated AI quality control at scale.** Handit.ai's evaluation system provides comprehensive quality assessment for your AI models using advanced LLM-as-Judge technology, delivering instant feedback on model performance through our intuitive platform interface.

Transform your AI quality control from reactive spot-checking to proactive, comprehensive monitoring.

## The Manual Review Challenge

Picture this: Your AI chatbot handles thousands of customer inquiries daily. You suspect quality is declining, but manually reviewing responses is overwhelming. You randomly check 50 conversations and find issues—but what about the other 4,950 interactions?

**Manual evaluation doesn't scale.** You need:
- **Consistency** - Different reviewers have different standards
- **Coverage** - You can't manually check every interaction  
- **Speed** - By the time you review, the damage is done
- **Objectivity** - Human reviewers bring unconscious bias
- **Specificity** - Understanding exactly what needs improvement

<Callout type="info">
  Handit.ai solves this by using AI to evaluate AI—at scale, consistently, and with focused insights. All setup and monitoring happens through our platform interface with no API integration required.

## LLM-as-Judge Technology

Leverage powerful language models to assess the quality, accuracy, and relevance of your AI outputs with human-level understanding.

**How it works:**
- **Model integration** - Connect GPT models and Llama (via Together AI) through the platform
- **Automated evaluation** - Run on specified percentage of your production traffic
- **Real-time insights** - Get quality scores within seconds through the dashboard
- **Historical tracking** - Monitor quality trends and improvements over time

## Single-Purpose Evaluator Framework

The key to effective AI evaluation is **focus**. Each evaluator should assess one specific quality dimension for maximum clarity and actionable insights.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Critical Best Practice**: Never combine multiple quality checks in one evaluator. Create separate evaluators for completeness, accuracy, format, empathy, etc. This provides actionable insights and reliable scoring.
</Callout>

### Why Single-Purpose Works Better

**❌ What Doesn't Work:**
```
One evaluator checking: helpfulness + accuracy + tone + format + compliance
Result: Vague scores, unclear what needs improvement
```

**✅ What Works:**
```
Completeness Evaluator: Does the response address all parts of the question?
Accuracy Evaluator: Is the information factually correct?
Format Evaluator: Does it follow the required structure?
Empathy Evaluator: Does it show understanding for the user's situation?
```

**Result**: Clear, actionable insights on exactly what to improve

## Platform Workflow

Everything happens through the intuitive Handit.ai platform interface:

### 1. Connect Model Tokens
Add your evaluation models and test connections:
- **GPT-4o models** (OpenAI) 
- **Llama v4 models** (Together AI)
- Test connections and save configurations

*[Image placeholder: Model token configuration screen]*

### 2. Create Focused Evaluators
Build single-purpose evaluators in the Evaluation Suite:
- Define specific evaluation prompts
- Associate with appropriate model tokens
- Focus on one quality dimension per evaluator

*[Image placeholder: Evaluator creation interface]*

### 3. Associate to LLM Nodes
Connect evaluators to your AI functions:
- Link evaluators to specific AI functions
- Set evaluation percentages (5-15% recommended to start)
- Configure priorities for different quality aspects

*[Image placeholder: Evaluator association configuration]*

### 4. Monitor & Analyze
View comprehensive quality insights:
- Real-time evaluation results
- Quality trends across different aspects
- Actionable insights and patterns

## Quality Dimensions

### Customer Service Evaluators
- **Completeness** - Does the response address all parts of the question?
- **Empathy** - Does it show understanding and care?
- **Solution Clarity** - Are instructions clear and actionable?
- **Policy Compliance** - Does it follow company guidelines?
- **Escalation Appropriateness** - When should it suggest human help?

### Technical Support Evaluators
- **Technical Accuracy** - Is the technical information correct?
- **Safety Check** - Are suggested actions safe?
- **Troubleshooting Flow** - Does it follow logical diagnostic steps?
- **Solution Completeness** - Does it provide a full resolution path?
- **Risk Assessment** - Are there potential negative consequences?

### Content Generation Evaluators
- **Brand Alignment** - Does it match company voice and values?
- **Factual Accuracy** - Is information correct and current?
- **Format Compliance** - Does it follow required structure?
- **Engagement Level** - Is it compelling and interesting?
- **Target Audience** - Is it appropriate for intended readers?
