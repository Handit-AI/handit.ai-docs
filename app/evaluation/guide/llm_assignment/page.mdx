# LLM Node Assignment

> **Connect evaluators to your AI functions.** Assign custom evaluators to your LLM nodes for automated quality assessment of your AI responses.

Learn the simple process of associating your custom evaluators with specific LLM nodes in your system.

<Callout type="info">
  Before assigning evaluators, ensure you have [created custom evaluators](/evaluation/guide/custom_evaluators) and configured [model tokens](/evaluation/guide/model_tokens).
</Callout>

## Assignment Methods

You can associate evaluators with LLM nodes in two ways:

<Steps>
### From Evaluation Suite
Select your evaluator and associate it with LLM nodes

### From Agent Performance Dashboard
Use the three-dot menu on LLM nodes to manage evaluator associations
</Steps>

## Method 1: From Evaluation Suite

**1. Navigate to Evaluation Suite**
- Go to **Evaluation Suite**
- Find the evaluator you want to assign

*[Image placeholder: Evaluation Suite with list of evaluators]*

**2. Associate LLM Node**
- Click on your evaluator
- Click **Associate LLM Node**
- Select the model/node you want to evaluate

*[Image placeholder: Associate LLM Node interface with model selection]*

**3. Confirm Association**
- Review your selection
- Click **Save** to create the association

## Method 2: From Agent Performance Dashboard

**1. Navigate to Agent Performance**
- Go to **Agent Performance** dashboard
- Locate the LLM node you want to evaluate

*[Image placeholder: Agent Performance dashboard showing LLM nodes]*

**2. Manage Evaluators**
- Click the **three-dot menu** on the LLM node
- Select **Add Evaluators** to associate new evaluators
- Or select **Remove Evaluators** to remove existing associations

*[Image placeholder: Three-dot menu showing Add/Remove Evaluators options]*

**3. Select and Save**
- Choose which evaluators to associate with this node
- Save your selections

## Multiple Evaluator Management

Assign multiple evaluators to the same LLM node for comprehensive quality assessment:

**Example: Customer Support Node**
```
Node: Customer Support LLM

Associated Evaluators:
✅ Response Quality Check
✅ Safety Compliance  
✅ Customer Satisfaction
```

*[Image placeholder: Multiple evaluator assignment interface]*

**Benefits:**
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Evaluate different quality dimensions
- **Specialized Focus**: Each evaluator targets specific criteria
- **Balanced Coverage**: Combine accuracy, safety, and user experience metrics

## Best Practices

### Start Simple
- Begin with one evaluator per node
- Add more evaluators as you understand the system
- Focus on your most critical AI functions first

### Choose Relevant Evaluators
- **Customer Support**: Helpfulness and professionalism evaluators
- **Content Generation**: Accuracy and engagement evaluators  
- **Technical Support**: Safety and completeness evaluators

### Monitor and Optimize
- Check evaluation results regularly in your dashboard
- Adjust evaluator associations based on insights
- Remove evaluators that aren't providing value

## Removing Associations

To remove an evaluator from an LLM node:

- Click the three-dot menu on the LLM node in **Agent Performance**
- Select **Remove Evaluators**
- Choose which evaluators to remove
- Confirm the removal

*[Image placeholder: Remove evaluators interface]*

## Next Steps

Your evaluators are now associated with LLM nodes and will automatically assess AI responses:

- [Monitor evaluation results](/evaluation/guide/evaluation_results) to track quality trends
- Adjust evaluator associations based on performance insights
- Scale evaluation across additional nodes as needed

  **Your evaluators are now running!** They will automatically assess AI responses and provide quality insights in your dashboard.
