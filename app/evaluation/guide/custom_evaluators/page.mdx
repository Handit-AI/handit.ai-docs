# Custom Evaluators

> **Define your quality standards with precision.** Custom evaluators allow you to create sophisticated evaluation systems tailored to your specific business requirements, ensuring AI responses meet your exact quality criteria.

This guide covers creating evaluation systems that automatically assess AI responses against your defined standards using LLM-as-Judge methodology.

<Callout type="info">
  Custom evaluators use your [configured model tokens](/evaluation/guide/model_tokens) to automatically assess AI responses against your defined criteria.
</Callout>

## Evaluator Components

A custom evaluator consists of:

<Steps>
### Evaluation Criteria
Define what constitutes quality for your specific use case
- Identify key quality dimensions
- Set clear scoring guidelines
- Define minimum acceptable thresholds

### Evaluation Prompt  
Instruction template that guides the judge model
- Clear role definition
- Specific evaluation criteria
- Context requirements
- Output format specifications

### Scoring Framework
How to interpret and score responses consistently
- Numerical scoring scale (e.g., 1-10)
- Weighted criteria if needed
- Confidence scoring

### Output Format
Structured format for evaluation results and insights
- JSON schema for consistency
- Required fields and data types
- Optional metadata fields
- Error handling format
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Pro tip:** Start with a simple evaluator focusing on 3-5 key criteria, then expand as you gather more data and insights about your AI's performance.
</Callout>

**2. Basic Configuration**

**Evaluator Name**
```
Customer Support Quality
```
- Use descriptive, purpose-specific names
- Include version number if applicable
- Consider environment prefix (dev/prod)

**Model Token**
- Select your configured judge model from the dropdown
- Choose based on evaluation complexity and cost requirements
- Consider model capabilities and limitations
- Factor in response time requirements

**3. Create Evaluation Prompt**

This is where you define your evaluation criteria and instructions for the judge model, example:

```
You are evaluating customer service AI responses for quality.

Rate the response on these criteria (1-10 scale, 10 = excellent):

1. **Helpfulness**: Does the response directly address and solve the customer's issue?
2. **Accuracy**: Is all provided information correct and up-to-date?
3. **Professionalism**: Is the tone and language appropriate for business communication?
4. **Completeness**: Are all aspects of the customer's question thoroughly addressed?

**Context:**
- Customer Question: {input}
- AI Response: {output}
- Customer History: {context}

**Output Format (JSON):**
{
  "scores": {
    "helpfulness": <1-10>,
    "accuracy": <1-10>,
    "professionalism": <1-10>,
    "completeness": <1-10>,
    "overall": <average>
  },
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of scoring decisions",
  "strengths": ["What the response did well"],
  "improvements": ["Specific areas for improvement"],
  "escalation_needed": <true/false>
}

Provide detailed, constructive feedback to help improve response quality.
```

**4. Save Evaluator**
- Review your configuration
- Click **Save** to create the evaluator
