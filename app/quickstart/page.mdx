# Set Up Your Autonomous Engineer

> **The autonomous engineer that fixes your AI 24/7** <br />
> Handit catches failures, writes fixes, tests them, and ships PRs, automatically. Like having an on-call engineer dedicated to your AI, except it works 24/7.

<Callout type="info">
  **What you're setting up:** Your autonomous engineer that monitors your AI, detects issues, creates fixes, and ships them via pull requests‚Äîall automatically.
</Callout>

## What Your Autonomous Engineer Will Do

Once set up, your autonomous engineer will:

- **Monitor** every AI interaction for quality issues and failures
- **Detect** patterns in problems before they become critical
- **Generate** improved system prompts that fix the issues  
- **Test** the fixes against real data to ensure they work
- **Create** pull requests in your repository with the improvements
- **Work 24/7** so you don't have to wake up to AI failures

<Callout type="success">
  **The Result**: Your AI continuously improves itself through your normal GitHub workflow, with zero manual intervention required.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your autonomous engineer:

- A [Handit.ai Account](https://dashboard.handit.ai) (sign up if needed)
- Node.js installed (for the CLI)
- Admin access to your GitHub repository
- 10-15 minutes for the complete setup

## Setting Up Your Autonomous Engineer

Your autonomous engineer setup happens in one seamless flow through the Handit CLI. Here's what will happen:

### Step 1: Install the Handit CLI

```bash filename="terminal"
npm install -g @handit.ai/cli
```

### Step 2: Start the Setup Process

Navigate to your AI project directory and run:

```bash filename="terminal"
handit-cli setup
```

The CLI will guide you through connecting your autonomous engineer to your AI system:

**üîß Initial Connection**
- Connect your Handit.ai account
- Generate integration code for your AI project
- Set up monitoring and tracing automatically

</video>

**üì± Test Your Connection**
- The CLI will ask you to run your app to verify everything works
- Your autonomous engineer immediately starts monitoring your AI
- You'll see real-time data flowing in your dashboard

</video>

**üß† Connect Evaluation Models**
- The CLI will ask if you want to set up quality evaluation
- Connect evaluation models (OpenAI, Together AI, etc.) so your autonomous engineer can assess quality
- Configure which evaluators to use and how often to run them

**üîó Connect Your GitHub Repository**  
- Finally, the CLI will ask you to connect your GitHub repository
- Install the Handit GitHub app so your autonomous engineer can create pull requests
- Configure repository permissions for automated fixes

</video>

<Callout type="success">
  **Setup Complete!** Your autonomous engineer is now monitoring your AI, evaluating quality, and ready to create pull requests with fixes whenever issues are detected.
</Callout>

## How Your Autonomous Engineer Works

Once setup is complete, here's what happens automatically:

**üîç Continuous Monitoring**
- Your autonomous engineer watches every AI interaction
- Tracks quality scores, response times, and error patterns
- Builds understanding of what good vs. bad performance looks like

**üö® Issue Detection**  
- Detects when quality drops or new types of failures appear
- Identifies root causes by analyzing patterns in your data
- Prioritizes the most impactful issues to fix first

**üõ†Ô∏è Automatic Fix Generation**
- Creates improved system prompts that address the detected issues
- Tests fixes against your real data to ensure they actually work
- Validates improvements with statistical confidence

**üìù Pull Request Creation**
- Opens a PR in your repository with the improved system prompt
- Includes detailed performance data showing the improvement
- Follows your existing code review and deployment process

**Example:** If your customer service AI starts giving incomplete responses, your autonomous engineer detects this pattern, generates a better system prompt that addresses completeness, tests it against real conversations, and creates a PR to replace the old prompt in your codebase.

## Viewing Your Autonomous Engineer's Work
