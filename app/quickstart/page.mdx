# Quickstart Guide

Get started with Handit.ai in minutes. This guide will walk you through the basic setup.

### Sign Up

Create an account at [handit.ai](https://handit.ai/signup) to get started with Handit.ai. You'll need to provide your email address and set up a password.

### Install

Install Handit SDK.

    ```bash filename="terminal" 
    pip install -U "handit-sdk>=1.9.0" 
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash filename="terminal" 
    npm install @handit.ai/node 
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure Your API Key

To use Handit.ai, you'll need to set up your API key. You can find your API key in your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.handit.ai/settings/integrations).

```bash filename=".env"
HANDIT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Never commit your API key. Use environment variables or a secure configuration
  management system.

### Create your Agent Flow

An agent flow is a sequence of connected steps (nodes) that define how your AI agent processes information and performs tasks. Think of it as a flowchart where each node can be either an AI model or a tool, and the connections determine how data moves between them.

<Callout type="important">
  **Key Concepts to Keep in Mind:**
  
  - **Model Node**: Represents any function or endpoint that uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to process or generate content. Examples include text generation, classification, or any AI-powered analysis.
  
  - **Tool Node**: Represents any function or endpoint that performs standard operations without LLM involvement. Examples include data processing, API calls, calculations, or any traditional programming logic.
</Callout>

Follow these steps to create your first agent in Handit.ai:


**Access the Dashboard**

    - Log in to your [Handit.ai Dashboard](https://dashboard.handit.ai)
    - Navigate to "Your Agents" in the sidebar
    - Click "Create Agent" to begin 

**Add Nodes to Your Agent Flow**

   - Click "Add Node" to create your first step
   - Choose between two node types:
     - **Model Node**: For AI tasks like prediction or generation
     - **Tool Node**: For utility functions or API integrations
   - Configure each node with:
     - Name and unique identifier
     - Description of functionality
     - Node type and settings
     - Next steps in the flow

**Connect Your Nodes**

   - Create connections between nodes by dragging from one to another
   - Define the data flow and execution path
   - Ensure logical flow between steps

**Finalize Your Agent**
   - Click "Create" to save your agent
   - Provide a descriptive name and purpose
   - Verify your agent appears in the "Your Agents" list

  You can always edit your agent's configuration later through the dashboard.
