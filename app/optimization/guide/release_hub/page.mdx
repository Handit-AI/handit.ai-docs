# Release Hub & Prompt Selection

The Release Hub is your central dashboard for managing prompt selection and deployment. View your LLM nodes, compare prompt performance, and choose which prompt to mark as production with a simple click.

<Callout type="info">
  The Release Hub shows all your LLM nodes and their available prompts. Compare metrics and text, then select your chosen prompt to mark as production.
</Callout>

## How It Works

Managing prompts in Release Hub follows a simple workflow:

<Steps>
### View Your LLM Nodes
See all your LLM nodes and their current production prompt status

### Compare Performance
Review metrics comparison and side-by-side text differences

### Select Best Prompt
Choose which prompt to mark as production based on performance data

### Mark as Production
Click to mark as production - prompt becomes available for your applications to fetch

## Accessing Release Hub

Navigate to the Release Hub by clicking **Optimization** in the main navigation, then selecting **Release Hub** from the sidebar.

### LLM Node Overview

The Release Hub displays all your LLM nodes with:

**Current Status:**
- Which prompt is currently marked as production for each node
- Available optimized prompts ready for selection
- A/B testing results and confidence levels
- Performance improvement metrics

**Available Actions:**
- Compare prompts side-by-side
- View detailed performance metrics
- Mark new prompts as production
- Access selection history

## Comparing Prompts

### Performance Analysis

For each LLM node, you can compare:

**Quality Metrics:**
- Current prompt performance scores
- Optimized prompt performance scores
- Improvement percentages for each metric
- Statistical confidence levels

**Business Impact:**
- Customer satisfaction changes
- Efficiency improvements
- Cost implications
- ROI estimates

**A/B Testing Results:**
- Sample size and test duration
- Statistical significance
- Confidence intervals
- Recommendation strength

### Text Comparison

**Side-by-Side Analysis:**

**Current vs Optimized:**
- Full text of current production prompt
- Full text of optimized prompt candidate
- Highlighted differences between versions
- Character and token count changes

**Key Changes:**
- What was added or removed
- Structural improvements
- Tone and style modifications
- Instruction clarity enhancements

**Impact Analysis:**
- Why changes improve performance
- Expected user experience improvements
- Trade-offs and considerations

## Marking Prompts as Production

### Simple Selection Process

When you're ready to mark an optimized prompt as production:

**Selection Process:**
1. Review the comparison metrics and text
2. Click "Mark as Production" on your chosen prompt
3. Confirm selection in the popup
4. Prompt becomes the new production version

**What Happens:**
- Previous prompt is archived (still accessible)
- New prompt becomes the "production" version
- Applications can fetch the new prompt via SDK
- Selection is logged with timestamp and user

**SDK Integration:**
Once marked as production, your applications can fetch the new prompt via SDK calls. See the [SDK Integration guide](/optimization/optimization_features/cicd_deployment) for implementation details.
