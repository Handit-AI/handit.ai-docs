# Autonomous AI Fixes

> **Your autonomous engineer that works 24/7.** Handit automatically detects quality issues, generates better prompts, tests them, and creates pull requests with proven improvements‚Äîlike having an on-call engineer dedicated to your AI.

<details>
<summary>**Why You Need an Autonomous Engineer**</summary>

- **24/7 monitoring**: Never miss quality issues, even during off-hours
- **Instant fixes**: Generate and test improvements automatically
- **Zero downtime**: Background A/B testing with no user impact
- **Pull request workflow**: Seamless integration with your existing development process
- **Evidence-based changes**: Every fix is backed by evaluation data
- **Continuous improvement**: Your AI gets better while you sleep

**Stop being your AI's on-call engineer. Let Handit handle the monitoring and fixing.**

</details>

<summary>**The Problem: You're Your AI's On-Call Engineer**</summary>

Without an autonomous engineer, you're stuck being the on-call engineer for your AI:

- **Alerts wake you up**: Quality drops and you get paged at 2 AM
- **Manual investigation**: Hours spent debugging what went wrong
- **Guesswork fixes**: Tweaking prompts based on intuition, not data
- **Risky deployments**: No way to safely test if changes actually improve things
- **Endless cycle**: Fix one issue, three more pop up next week

**The result? You're constantly firefighting AI issues instead of building features.**

<Callout type="info">
  Your autonomous engineer works through GitHub pull requests‚Äîseamlessly integrating with your existing development workflow while you focus on building features.

## How Your Autonomous Engineer Works

Handit.ai creates an intelligent optimization loop that continuously improves your AI system:

<div className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4 mt-4">
  <div>
    <h4>üîç 1. Detect Issues</h4>
    Evaluation system identifies specific quality problems in production responses
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>üß† 2. Generate Solutions</h4>
    AI analyzes problems and generates improved prompts targeting specific issues
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>‚ö° 3. Test Automatically</h4>
    Background testing processes production inputs through optimized prompts for evaluation comparison
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>üöÄ 4. Recommend Deployment</h4>
    Provide clear deployment recommendations based on statistical evidence - you decide when to deploy
  </div>
</div>

## Core Optimization Features

### Self-Improving AI

Automatically generates better prompts based on evaluation insights:

<details>
<summary>**Intelligent Problem Analysis**</summary>

- **Error detection**: Uses evaluation results to identify specific quality issues
- **Problem categorization**: AI analyzes and categorizes different types of failures
- **Root cause analysis**: Understands why responses fail (lack of context, wrong tone, missing information)
- **Solution generation**: Creates targeted prompt improvements for each problem type
- **Learning from patterns**: Improves optimization strategies based on what works

</details>

### Automated A/B Testing

Every optimization is tested automatically in the background against your current production prompt:

<details>
<summary>**Background Evaluation Testing**</summary>

- **Zero user impact**: Users always receive production prompt responses
- **Background processing**: Takes production inputs and processes them through optimized prompts for evaluation
- **Real data testing**: Uses actual production inputs to measure performance differences
- **Statistical comparison**: Compares evaluation scores between production and optimized prompts
- **Safe experimentation**: Testing happens invisibly without affecting user experience

</details>

### CI/CD Deployment

Seamlessly integrate optimized prompts into your existing development workflow:

<details>
<summary>**Production-Ready Integration**</summary>

- **Release Hub**: Visual interface to compare prompt performance and select for deployment
- **SDK integration**: Fetch optimized prompts directly in your code - deployed prompts become available via SDK
- **Version control**: Track all prompt changes and easily rollback if needed
- **Zero-downtime updates**: Prompt changes take effect immediately when fetched via SDK

</details>

## Platform-Based Workflow

Everything happens through the intuitive Handit.ai platform interface:

### 1. Connect Optimization Models
- Add GPT-4o or other models for optimization analysis
- Configure optimization preferences and constraints
- Set quality thresholds and improvement targets
- Self-improving AI automatically activates when optimization tokens are configured

### 2. Monitor A/B Tests
- View real-time performance comparisons
- Track statistical significance and confidence levels
- Analyze business impact of optimizations
