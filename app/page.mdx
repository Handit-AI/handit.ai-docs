## Alerts Wake You Up. We Fix the Problem.

Most tools stop at notifications. **Handit is the engineer who actually ships the fix.**

Your current tools tell you when AI fails at 2am. Handit catches the failure, diagnoses the issue, writes the fix, tests it on real data, and ships a PR—all before you wake up. 

**Open source because you need to trust what pushes to prod.**



## Your Autonomous Engineer in Action

From failure to fix in production—fully automated, fully auditable, fully open-source.

### 🔍 **Detect - On-Call 24/7**
Monitors every request, catches failures in real-time before customers complain. Never miss hallucinations, schema breaks, PII leaks, or performance issues.

### 🧠 **Diagnose & Fix - AI-Powered Insights** 
Analyzes root causes, generates fixes and tests solutions on actual failure cases in production. Writes production-ready code that actually works.

### 🚀 **Ship - GitHub-Native**

### 🚨 **Real-Time Failure Detection**
**Never Miss a Failure:** Catches hallucinations, schema breaks, PII leaks, and performance issues as they happen. No more finding out from angry customers.

### 🤖 **Automated Fix Generation** 
**Writes Production-Ready Code:** Generates prompt improvements, config changes, and guardrails. Tests each fix against real failures before shipping.

### 📊 **A/B Testing & Validation**
**Data-Driven Decisions:** Every fix is tested on live data. See exact accuracy improvements, latency impacts, and success rates before deploying.

### 🧠 **Fix Registry & Memory**
**Gets Smarter Over Time:** Remembers every failure and successful fix. Instantly applies proven solutions to recurring issues. Your engineer's growing expertise.

**Example:** Your customer service AI starts giving incomplete responses at 2am. Handit detects this pattern, generates a better solution, tests it against real data, and creates a PR with the fix—all before you wake up.
