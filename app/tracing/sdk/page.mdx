# SDK Overview

Welcome to the Handit.ai SDK documentation. Our SDKs provide comprehensive tracking and monitoring capabilities for your AI applications, helping you understand and optimize your AI systems' performance.

<Callout type="info">
  The Handit.ai SDKs automatically track HTTP requests, agent executions, and custom events, providing detailed insights into your AI application's behavior and performance.
</Callout>

## Python SDK

The Python SDK is designed for AI applications built with Python, offering seamless integration with popular frameworks and libraries.

<Callout type="info">
  Key features of the Python SDK:
  - Automatic request tracking
  - Agent execution monitoring
  - Model performance tracking
  - Custom event tracking
  - Performance optimization
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  The Python SDK requires Python 3.7+ and supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
</Callout>

### Core Capabilities

- **Agent Tracing**: Track complete agent execution flows
- **Node Tracing**: Monitor individual components and tools
- **Model Tracking**: Capture model inputs, outputs, and performance
- **Request Interception**: Automatically track HTTP requests
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure and optimize system performance
- **Custom Events**: Track any custom events in your application

<Callout type="info">
  The Python SDK integrates seamlessly with popular AI frameworks like LangChain, providing automatic tracking of agent executions and model calls.
</Callout>

## JavaScript SDK

The JavaScript SDK is built for Node.js applications, offering powerful tracking capabilities for your AI systems.

<Callout type="info">
  Key features of the JavaScript SDK:
  - Automatic HTTP request tracking
  - Agent execution monitoring
  - Model performance tracking
  - Custom event tracking
  - Performance optimization
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  The JavaScript SDK requires Node.js 14+ and supports both CommonJS and ES modules.
</Callout>

### Core Capabilities

- **Agent Tracing**: Track complete agent execution flows
- **Node Tracing**: Monitor individual components and tools
- **Model Tracking**: Capture model inputs, outputs, and performance
- **Request Interception**: Automatically track HTTP requests
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure and optimize system performance
- **Custom Events**: Track any custom events in your application

<Callout type="info">
  The JavaScript SDK provides automatic tracking for both Axios and Fetch API requests, making it easy to monitor all HTTP communications in your application.
</Callout>

## Common Features
