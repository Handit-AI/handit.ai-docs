# AI Agent Tracing

> **Every AI agent is a black box until you add tracing.** See exactly what your agents are doing, why they're failing, and how to make them better.

Tracing captures the complete execution flow of your AI agents‚Äîfrom the initial user request to the final response. Think of it as a flight recorder for your AI: when something goes wrong (or right), you have the complete story.

<Callout type="info">
  Tracing transforms AI development from guesswork to data-driven optimization. See every LLM call, tool execution, and decision your agents make.
</Callout>

## Why AI Agents Need Tracing

AI agents are inherently complex‚Äîthey make decisions, call tools, interact with LLMs, and chain operations together. Without tracing, you're debugging in the dark.

<details>
<summary>**üîç Visibility - See Inside the Black Box**</summary>

**What you get:**
- Complete execution flow of every agent run
- Every LLM call with exact prompts and responses  
- All tool executions and their results
- Decision points and reasoning chains
- Context flow between operations

**Why it matters:**
Your agent might be failing because of a subtle prompt issue, a tool returning unexpected data, or a logic error in the chain. Tracing shows you exactly where and why.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**üêõ Debugging - Fix Issues Fast**</summary>

**What you get:**
- Pinpoint exact failure locations in complex chains
- See the exact inputs that caused errors
- Track error propagation through your agent
- Access complete stack traces and context
- Compare successful vs failed executions

**Why it matters:**
Instead of spending hours reproducing bugs, you see exactly what happened in production. Debug in minutes instead of days.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**‚ö° Optimization - Make Agents Faster & Better**</summary>

**What you get:**
- Execution time breakdown for every operation
- Performance bottleneck identification  
- Input/output analysis for optimization opportunities
- Error pattern detection
- Prompt engineering insights

**Why it matters:**
See which parts of your agent are slow or causing issues. Optimize prompts, reduce unnecessary operations, and improve performance with data, not guesswork.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**üìä Monitoring - Keep Production Healthy**</summary>

**What you get:**
- Real-time performance metrics
- Success/failure rate tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Alert integration for anomalies
- Historical trend analysis

**Why it matters:**
Know when your agents start failing before your users complain. Monitor performance trends and catch issues early.

</details>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Production AI agents without tracing are a ticking time bomb.** When they fail‚Äîand they will‚Äîyou need complete visibility to fix them quickly.
</Callout>

## What Handit.ai Tracing Captures

Every execution creates a complete trace with:

| **Data Type** | **What's Captured** | **Example** |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Execution Flow** | Complete operation sequence | User request ‚Üí LLM reasoning ‚Üí tool calls ‚Üí final response |
| **LLM Interactions** | Prompts, responses, and timing | "Analyze this data..." ‚Üí 1.2s ‚Üí "The data shows..." |
| **Tool Executions** | Input parameters, outputs, errors | `search_web("AI agents")` ‚Üí 10 results ‚Üí 0.8s |
| **Performance** | Timing and resource usage | Total: 3.2s, LLM: 1.2s, Tools: 0.8s |
| **Context** | Data flow between operations | Search results ‚Üí LLM analysis ‚Üí structured output |

## Tracing Components

### ü§ñ Agent Tracing
**The orchestrator** - Tracks your entire agent from start to finish.

Captures the complete agent execution as a single trace, automatically linking all LLM calls, tool executions, and operations together. This is your agent's "flight recorder."

**Best for:** Main agent workflows, API endpoints, complex multi-step processes

<details>
<summary>**What Agent Tracing Records**</summary>

- **Complete execution timeline** with start/end times
- **All child operations** (LLM calls, tool executions) automatically linked
- **Success/failure status** with detailed error context
- **Input/output data** for the entire agent run
- **Performance metrics** including total duration and resource usage
- **Error handling** with retry attempts and recovery actions

**Example Use Cases:**
- Customer support agent handling user queries
- Research agent gathering and analyzing information  
- Code generation agent creating and testing solutions

</details>

### üß† LLM Node Tracing
**The brain monitor** - Tracks every interaction with language models.

Records complete details of LLM interactions including prompts, responses, and performance. Essential for understanding and optimizing your agent's reasoning.

**Best for:** LLM calls, prompt engineering, performance optimization

<details>
<summary>**What LLM Node Tracing Records**</summary>

- **Complete prompts and responses** with exact text
- **Model parameters** (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
- **Response timing** and latency analysis
- **Error handling** for failed LLM calls
- **Input/output data flow** between operations

**Example Use Cases:**
- GPT-4 calls for reasoning and analysis
- Claude for document processing
- Custom model endpoints
- Embedding generation for RAG systems

</details>

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Tracing  
**The action tracker** - Monitors every tool and function your agent uses.

Captures detailed information about tool executions, from simple functions to complex API calls. See exactly what tools are called, with what parameters, and what they return.

**Best for:** Custom functions, API calls, database queries, file operations

<details>
<summary>**What Tool Tracing Records**</summary>

- **Function parameters** and return values
- **Execution timing** and performance metrics
- **Error handling** with detailed error messages
- **Resource usage** for expensive operations
- **Side effects** like file writes or API calls
- **Retry logic** and failure recovery

**Example Use Cases:**
- Web search APIs for information gathering
- Database queries for data retrieval
- File processing and manipulation
- External service integrations
