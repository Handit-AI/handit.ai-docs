# AI Agent Tracing

> **Complete visibility into your AI agents.** See exactly what your agents are doing, why they're failing, and how your autonomous engineer uses this data to create fixes.

<Callout type="info">
  **Already set up Handit?** If you followed our [Main Quickstart](/quickstart), tracing is already working. This page explains what tracing captures and how to use the data.
</Callout>

## What Tracing Captures

When your autonomous engineer monitors your AI, it captures everything:

- **Every LLM call** with exact prompts and responses
- **All tool executions** and their results  
- **Complete execution flow** from request to response
- **Performance metrics** and timing data
- **Error details** with full context

This data powers the autonomous issue detection and fix generation.

## How to View Your Traces

Once tracing is active (via the [Main Quickstart](/quickstart)), you can view and analyze your AI's behavior:

### 1. **Real-Time Monitoring**
- Go to your [Handit Dashboard](https://beta.handit.ai)
- View live traces as your AI processes requests
- See performance metrics and success rates

### 2. **Trace Analysis**
- Click on individual traces to see the complete execution flow
- Analyze timing, inputs, outputs, and any errors
- Understand how your AI makes decisions

### 3. **Issue Detection**
- Watch as the autonomous engineer identifies patterns
- See which traces trigger quality concerns
- Monitor how fixes improve performance over time

## What Makes Great Traces

The autonomous engineer needs high-quality trace data to detect issues and generate fixes effectively:

### **üìä Comprehensive Coverage**
- **Trace all critical paths** - Every user request should generate a complete trace
- **Include context** - Capture user inputs, intermediate steps, and final outputs
- **Track performance** - Monitor timing and resource usage
- **Log errors** - Capture failures with full context for analysis

### **üîç Rich Detail**
- **LLM interactions** - Full prompts and responses for analysis
- **Tool executions** - Parameters, results, and timing data
- **Decision points** - Why your AI chose specific actions
- **Data flow** - How information moves through your agent

### **‚ö° Real-Time Streaming**
- **Live monitoring** - See traces as they happen
- **Immediate detection** - Issues identified as they occur
- **Fast feedback** - Quick iteration on improvements

## Understanding Your Traces

Your dashboard shows different types of traces that help the autonomous engineer understand your AI:

### **ü§ñ Agent Traces**
Complete workflows from start to finish showing:
- How your AI processes user requests
- Which tools and LLMs are called
- Success/failure patterns
- Performance bottlenecks

### **üß† LLM Node Traces**  
Individual language model interactions showing:
- Exact prompts sent to the model
- Complete responses received
- Token usage and costs
- Response quality patterns

### **üõ†Ô∏è Tool Traces**
External function and API calls showing:
- What parameters were passed
- What results were returned
- Execution timing
- Error conditions

## How the Autonomous Engineer Uses Traces

Your traces power the autonomous issue detection and fix generation:

1. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifies when traces show declining quality or increasing errors
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Pinpoints exactly which component is causing issues
3. **Fix Generation** - Creates improved prompts based on successful vs failed traces
4. **Validation** - Tests fixes against historical trace data before deployment

## Need Manual Setup?

If you need custom tracing configuration beyond the CLI setup, check our [Advanced Tracing Guide](/tracing/guide/cli_setup) for detailed manual integration steps.

## Next Steps

- View your traces in the [Handit Dashboard](https://beta.handit.ai)
- Set up [Evaluation](/evaluation/quickstart) to score trace quality
- Enable [Autonomous Fixes](/optimization/quickstart) based on trace analysis
- Explore [Advanced Tracing Features](/tracing/tracing_features/overview)
